    1. Passwords no longer stored in entries.dat file.

    3. When you add or update an entry it does DNS checks on the hostname
       or gateway hostname to make sure they will resolve.
    4. When adding or updating an entry the alert window now tells you
       everything you got wrong instead of only telling you the first one.
